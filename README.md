# CS4084_Project
  
  Our app is a Google maps-based marketplace app that allows users to buy and sell items using Google maps to locate items to pick up
and set locations for their items to be picked up at. This is done by getting the users device location upon them creating an item post. The app contains the colour scheme of the University of Limerick throughout and offers an easy-to-use user interface.

Set Up -
     The app requires creating an account with an email and password. It also requests a user name which
     must be provided as well. When the users account is made, that user will have the option to log-in with their saved details. The email and password are the only required        details to log-in to the app.
     Aside from this, there is nothing else needed to access the app features.
